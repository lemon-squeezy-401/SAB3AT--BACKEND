### Conflict Plan

---

- Team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.

- Making sure the team had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability.

- when the team gather, they norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.

- wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.

- To maximize the group score was for each person to sacrifice an item he really wanted for something the team needed.

- Any time you want to push your branch pull the main to be sure that all updated.
